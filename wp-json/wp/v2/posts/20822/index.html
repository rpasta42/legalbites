Say Goodbye to Out-of-State Fees!&#8221; isn&#8217;t just an intriguing headline; it heralds a new age in higher education affordability for many families. Senator Perry has tossed a lifeline to students nationwide with the introduction of Senate Bill 1582, which promises a hefty reduction in education costs for those with Floridian roots.<\/p>\n<p>Picture this: Beginning with the 2023-2024 academic year, any out-of-state student who has either a Florida-residing grandparent or a parent employed by a Florida-incorporated entity could see the financial barrier of out-of-state tuition crumble before their eyes. Thanks to potential amendments to the Florida Statutes encapsulated in the new section 1009.264, the &#8220;Online fee discount&#8221; could be a game changer.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s break it down. Three of the Sunshine State&#8217;s major universities \u2013 the University of Florida, Florida State University, and the University of Central Florida \u2013 could waive out-of-state fees for eligible students enrolled in online undergraduate courses. The catch? You&#8217;d need a grandparent who&#8217;s a legal Florida resident or a parent working for a company that&#8217;s a Florida staple. Not to mention, you&#8217;d need a high school diploma equivalent to what Florida offers or have completed a home education program.<\/p>\n<p>The term &#8220;grandparent&#8221; gets a nod in the bill, defined traditionally as the parent or legal guardian of the student&#8217;s own parent. And don&#8217;t think the term &#8220;parent&#8221; slips by without a definition \u2013 it&#8217;s covered, too.<\/p>\n<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t an open-ended, carte blanche deal. The waiver covers up to 110 percent of the required credit hours for your degree. That&#8217;s it. And when it comes to proving those family ties or corporate connections, expect to sign on the dotted line with a declaration \u2013 and it&#8217;s serious stuff, with perjury penalties awaiting any tall tales.<\/p>\n<p>If anyone starts getting creative with the truth, the bill grants universities the right to pass any suspect declarations to law enforcement. It&#8217;s about maintaining integrity while offering this substantial financial break.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a cherry on top, too. Eligible students will jump ahead in the enrollment line over less qualified or ineligible out-of-state applicants when academic and other credentials are on a level playing field. Fair? Certainly strategic \u2013 Florida knows how to keep its talent close and its grandparent-grandchild relationships closer.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond the process of implementing these waivers, Florida&#8217;s mighty Board of Governors is tasked with setting up regulations to make sure everything runs smoothly. Annual reports will pinpoint the number and the value of fee waivers, keeping the system transparent.<\/p>\n<p>Scheduled to kick off on July 1, 2023, SB 1582 emphasizes affordability, accessibility, and familial bonds in higher education. Whether it sparks a trend or stands alone, one thing is sure \u2013 the bill presents a fascinating intersection of family ties and economic policy innovation in higher ed. For those with Floridian connections, the door to education is poised to swing open wider than ever before. How&#8217;s that for a sunshine state of mind?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Student Fee Discounts Florida&#8217;s latest legislative concoction just might have grandparents doing the happy dance. &#8220;Grandparents in Florida?
