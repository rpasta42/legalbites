Senator Berman&#8217;s introduction of Senate Concurrent Resolution 142 (SCR 142) in the Florida 2024 legislative session is not just another bill\u2014it&#8217;s a historical pivot aiming to etch equal rights for men and women into the very bedrock of America&#8217;s legal framework.<\/p>\n<p>The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) has lingered in a legislative purgatory since its approval by Congress in 1972\u2014a time of bell-bottoms and political ferment. Yet, the fight for constitutional equality has proved timeless, outliving the fashions and fervor of its birth decade, with SCR 142 as its latest champion.<\/p>\n<p>The bill doesn&#8217;t merely recount the ERA\u2019s journey; it propels the amendment back into the spotlight. The original text faced a ticking clock: a seven-year ratification deadline that Congress, recognizing the ERA&#8217;s significance, extended to 1982. Despite winning favor in 35 states, the ERA was left hanging without the 38-state majority needed to cross the finish line.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2021: the U.S. House of Representatives passed a retroactive measure seeking to scrap the ratification deadline with the Senate introducing a similar proposal. Although legal scholars debate the constitutionality of altering ratification deadlines post-expiration, this maneuver signaled a resurgence of interest in affirming the ERA&#8217;s place in the Constitution.<\/p>\n<p>Florida&#8217;s SCR 142 is more than a symbolic gesture. It&#8217;s a resolute statement that the fight for equality marches on. Section 1 of the ERA is unequivocal\u2014it prohibits the denial of rights on the basis of sex. Section 2 empowers Congress to guarantee these rights through legislation, and Section 3 gives the nation a two-year preparation period post-ratification.<\/p>\n<p>With constitutional equality achieved in numerous nations around the globe, the United States finds itself in an odd historical lag. SCR 142 offers Florida&#8217;s legislative support to not only join the ranks of these progressive nations but to also encourage the federal inclusion of the ERA in the American Constitution.<\/p>\n<p>If passed, Florida&#8217;s resolution would send certified copies to the highest levels of federal government, including the President, marking Florida&#8217;s legislative push for gender equality. This action is not just a nod to history\u2014it&#8217;s a clarion call for a more equitable future.<\/p>\n<p>But the question remains: is the statute of limitations on equality long expired, or is there no expiration on justice? Florida&#8217;s bold stance reignites old debates and challenges us to reconsider what we mean by inalienable rights. As this chapter of the ERA&#8217;s history unfolds, eyes turn to the Sunshine State, whose rays could illuminate a path to constitutional change. The nation watches; history waits.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Equal Rights for Men and Women In a move that&#8217;s reigniting a decades-long saga over gender equality, Florida has taken a bold stance that may tip the scales in a national constitutional showdown.
