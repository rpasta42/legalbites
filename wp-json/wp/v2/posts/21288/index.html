But these earth movers are on the cusp of facing stricter rules that may leave them with more sand in their gears than they&#8217;d prefer.<\/p>\n<p>Florida Senate Bill 708 brandishes a new set of legal tools that could redefine the landscape for those who dare to dig. Sponsored by the meticulous Senator Burton, this legislative blueprint aims to revamp the dusty old Section 556.105 of the Florida Statutes, a section that could previously be seen as more of an operator&#8217;s guideline than a steadfast rulebook.<\/p>\n<p>The bill clutches at the fragile interplay between time and safety, extending the notification window for underground excavations from a mere two full business days to at least three, for lands high and dry. But if your shovels yearn to carve the depths below Florida&#8217;s azure waters, the waiting game lengthens from ten full days before disturbing the submerged slumber.<\/p>\n<p>As for the response time for member operators, tasked with marking the horizontal route of underground facilities, and providing their thumbs-up through the digger&#8217;s grapevine \u2014 aka the free-access notification system by Sunshine State One-Call of Florida, Inc. \u2014 they too must adjust their watches, although the exact extent of this adjustment remains a cryptic detail amidst the sandy clauses.<\/p>\n<p>Yet this bill isn&#8217;t just serving a triple scoop of delay for the industry&#8217;s big diggers; it&#8217;s also peppered with a dash of legal salt. Within its reordered text lurks a noncriminal but none-too-gentle slap on the wrist, an infraction brandishing the new weight of enhanced civil penalties. Violate thine sacred digging decrees, particularly around those high-priority subsurface defenses of the state, and watch your pockets feel lighter for the misdemeanor.<\/p>\n<p>Controversy stirs already beneath the surface with murmurs of discontent from stakeholders. They argue this hammer of legal delays might crush the efficiency of project timelines, forcing them into a game of &#8216;hurry up and wait.&#8217; Meanwhile, the imposing collection plate for penalties leaves a sour taste among operators \u2014 could these fines be a mere cash-grab or actually a necessary sting to prevent cavalier disruptions to our hidden veins of utility?<\/p>\n<p>Despite the constraints and costs that loom like storm clouds for Florida&#8217;s land-shapers, the silver lining spills out in the potential boost to safety measures. Senate Bill 708 seeks to button up those dig sites, ensuring that each scrape of the earth is informed, intentional, and far less likely to slice into something that could spark more than a mere &#8220;oops.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Poised to take effect on October 1, 2024, Senate Bill 708 drills home the serious business of excavation. With infrastructural integrity at stake, Florida draws a line in the sand, urging excavators to tread thoughtfully. Or better, dig thoughtfully, with the knowledge that their actions shape not just the ground, but the very foundations of Florida&#8217;s safety and services.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Underground Facilities Construction Chaos: New Bill in Florida Draws Line in the Sand for Excavators!
