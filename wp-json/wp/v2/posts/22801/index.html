Senate Bill 528 (SB 528), brought forth by Senator Davis, aims to tighten the reins on which inmates can be granted gain-time\u2014a means to incentivize and reward good behavior in prisons. But could this bill end up doing more harm than good? Let&#8217;s delve into the heart of this legislative puzzle.<\/p>\n<p>Gain-time, for those unfamiliar, is a tool used within the correctional system to not only motivate inmates to maintain commendable behavior but also to keep our prison populations at manageable levels. It allows inmates to reduce their sentence length, but up until now, this privilege has not been extended to those convicted of certain severe crimes. SB 528 proposes to double down on these exclusions by including those found guilty of attempted violations of these heinous offenses.<\/p>\n<p>But what does this mean in practice? For crimes committed after October 1, 2014, and before July 1, 2023, inmates are already denied gain-time for a list of offenses\u2014murders involving additional felonious acts, sexual battery and certain computer pornography related offenses, among others. The new bill seeks to expand this denial to individuals who have even made an attempt at such crimes.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the hitch: from July 1, 2023, onwards, should SB 528 be enacted, the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) will not be able to grant gain-time for attempts of these specified violent and sexual crimes. On the surface, this looks like a firm stance for public safety. Yet, there&#8217;s an undercurrent of apprehension about what this means for the future of those incarcerated who\u2014though guilty of attempt\u2014did not succeed in committing the full crime.<\/p>\n<p>The bone of contention, then, is this: does extending the gain-time restrictions to attempted offenses improve public safety, or does it just pave the way for an increasingly fraught and overcrowded prison system? Naysayers argue this move may undercut the possibilities for rehabilitation and throw a wrench into the workings of an already strained correctional system.<\/p>\n<p>Such legislation also serves up a plentiful food for thought: how effective are incentive-based systems within our prisons? Do they truly promote better behavior and serve our communities by preparing inmates for eventual reintegration? Or do we err on the side of caution, adopting a more punitive stance for even the shadow of a serious crime?<\/p>\n<p>What SB 528 makes clear is one fundamental truth: gain-time is no trivial matter in the eyes of the justice system\u2014it&#8217;s a potent force that can influence the paths of those who&#8217;ve veered off course. It&#8217;s a marker for how Florida weighs the scales of justice when it comes to the incentive for positive change against the demand for strict punishment. <\/p>\n<p>On the horizon, the effective start date of the bill looms\u2014July 1, 2023. With it comes the necessity to re-examine how the justice system operates when it comes to gain-time and what this all means for the inmates whose futures hang in the balance. Will SB 528 pave the way to safer streets, or will it simply be a push for an overload of the Sunshine State&#8217;s prisons? The debate is far from over, and the answers may shape the way forward for legal and penal reform in Florida and beyond.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Custody and Supervision of Specified Offenders In Florida, a new bill stirring controversy and debate has been introduced, and it&#8217;s raising key questions about the balance between public safety and the state&#8217;s approach to punishment and rehabilitation.
