Lawmakers have taken action with Senate Bill 788, sending a chilling message to would-be attackers: plan a mass shooting or act of terrorism, and you&#8217;ll find yourself in deep legal waters before a single shot is fired. <\/p>\n<p>The bill, introduced by Senator Powell, is a clarion call for preventive action. It significantly strengthens Florida&#8217;s stance against the premeditated savagery of mass shootings and terrorist acts \u2013 the very planning of which is now enough to warrant a second-degree felony charge. <\/p>\n<p>What does this mean for residents and internet users alike? Senate Bill 788 revises the term &#8216;electronic record&#8217;, an update for the digital age that seals any previous gaps. Gone are the days when telephone calls might slip through legal cracks; they are now fully encompassed in the statute. Texts, emails, videos, or even a threatening tweet could be the thread that unravels a nefarious plan &#8211; and lands the plotter behind bars.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the scenario where someone identifies a location to unleash terror, sets a date for the carnage, stocks up on weapons and ammunition, or even goes as far as conducting drills. Any combination of these actions, wrapped in a stated desire to cause unspeakable horror, now fits the bill&#8217;s definition of &#8216;planning&#8217;. <\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, this law doesn&#8217;t turn a blind eye to the modern world&#8217;s technological ploys. Setting up a livestream with insidious intent or penning a manifesto on the &#8216;hows&#8217; and &#8216;whys&#8217; of a planned attack will also land you squarely in the sights of Florida&#8217;s law enforcement. <\/p>\n<p>Importantly, the bill steers clear of placing unjust blame on service providers. The last thing our tech industry needs is a legal minefield \u2013 Senate Bill 788 ensures that platforms and providers won&#8217;t be held liable when their services are co-opted for evil.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, not all are celebrating. The expanded definition of &#8216;electronic record&#8217; has stirred controversy among privacy advocates and First Amendment champions. Free speech isn&#8217;t free if it&#8217;s fettered by what some view as overly broad definitions of wrongdoing, critics say. The very idea of what constitutes &#8216;planning&#8217; could spiral into an Orwellian nightmare of policing thought and innocent behavior.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the polemics, one thing crystallizes: as the bill&#8217;s enactment date of July 1, 2024, approaches, Floridians will live under a legal framework that is less about reaction, and all about prevention. Senate Bill 788 might just be the rigorous watchdog we need, prowling the periphery of our public safety \u2013 ready to silence the growls of potential aggressors before they ever reach a crescendo. <\/p>\n<p>Plan a mass shooting in Florida? Not without risking a swift and severe reckoning with the firm hand of the law. Senate Bill 788 is not just a new chapter in Florida&#8217;s legal ledgers; it is a bold declaration that the state values the safety of its communities enough to wage war on violence, starting with the malevolent musings of its potential architects.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Public Safety Amidst the sunshine and the buzz of daily life in the Sunshine State, a looming shadow often darkens the light: the threat of mass violence.
