In a bold move that&#8217;s setting the industry abuzz, lawmakers have tabled SPB 7044, a bill that&#8217;s ready to solidify the gambling game for the current heavy hitters and lockout potential newcomers dreaming of a jackpot.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just any legislative tweak\u2014it&#8217;s a full-blown fortress around Florida&#8217;s existing gambling institutions. The bill\u2014which reads like a poker game where no new players can join after the first hand\u2014states that only those who already had their cards on the table, metaphorically speaking, in fiscal year 2020-2021, or those waving a magic permit issued under s. 550.3345, can flaunt a pari-mutuel wagering license. So if you weren&#8217;t holding that operating license when the ball dropped to welcome 2021, the ante&#8217;s just been upped, and the house might not be your home.<\/p>\n<p>But what&#8217;s a little legal wrangling without a dash of controversy? Critics of the bill are shuffling their feet and calling their lawyers. Their argument? This legal languishing effectively freezes the market, clipping the wings of would-be gambling entrepreneurs before they even leave the launchpad. The restriction smells less like freshly printed cards and more like last year&#8217;s forgotten poker chips. The rigidity of operational necessity during the 2020-2021 fiscal year is particularly thorny. A year pillaged by the pandemic could mean those closed due to COVID-19 constraints are now shut out of the shindig.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not all. SPB 7044&#8217;s reach extends to the velvet-green poker tables and the hypnotic dance of spinning slot machines. If you&#8217;re holding onto a permit like a royal flush, you can transfer, purchase, or assign these permits\u2014but only with the nod from the discerning eyes of the Florida Gaming Control Commission, ensuring the game stays in familiar hands.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s cutthroat clarity with the bill&#8217;s amendment to subsection (5) of section 849.086 of the Florida Statutes. If you&#8217;ve got a cardroom and fancy keeping it, you better have been dealing from the get-go of the last fiscal year\u2014or hold that special permit from s. 550.3345. And for the thoroughbreds among permitholders, skipping out on a full schedule of live racing might just have you watching from the stands. Renew that license, and you&#8217;re committing to maintaining, if not outdoing, your previous year&#8217;s performance, or you&#8217;ll be folding your hand for good.<\/p>\n<p>As it stands, if the bill crosses the finish line and becomes law, it won&#8217;t be a slow and steady race. The implications are immediate\u2014the bill&#8217;s text makes no bones about its urgency to maintain the gambling status quo. No extra chips for the table, no new hands being dealt\u2014Florida&#8217;s gambling scene could find itself in an exclusive club where only the VIPs of yesteryear have a standing reservation.<\/p>\n<p>Florida&#8217;s Gambling Scene On Lockdown: New Bill Freezes Out Newcomers! The bill isn&#8217;t just news\u2014it&#8217;s a game-changer in a high-stakes industry where every player knows the house always wins. But in this hand, it seems the house isn&#8217;t taking any more bets. Keep your eyes on this space, as we watch the chips fall where they may.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Changes in Ownership of or Interest in Pari-mutuel Permits Florida&#8217;s sandy shores and sunny climes are no strangers to tourists and transplants, but the latest legal kerfuffle isn&#8217;t about who can visit, it&#8217;s about who can deal, shuffle, and spin in the Sunshine State&#8217;s gambling landscape.
