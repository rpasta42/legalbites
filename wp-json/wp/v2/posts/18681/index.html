Florida House Bill 7007 (HB 7007), proposed for the 2024 legislative session, seems poised to rewrite the rules on transparency and crisis management, chilling the open communication channels many have fought to establish.<\/p>\n<p>The bill in question takes aim at section 1004.0962 of the Florida Statutes, specifically clauses that once ensured a degree of transparency and cooperation between educational institutions and governmental entities during emergencies. The bone of contention? Proposed amendments to the Open Government Sunset Review Act that could potentially cloak emergency response plans in a shroud of secrecy.<\/p>\n<p>Under the existing provisions, certain records relating to campus security could be shared with government bodies&#8211;a practice predicated on the belief that the right to information and the demands of public duty could occasionally intersect. However, with the proposed striking out of subsections 5 and 6, a grim reality looms: a future where pertinent information is siloed, and inter-agency collaboration possibly impeded at critical junctures.<\/p>\n<p>The contentious bill doesn&#8217;t merely curb the existing flow of information; it seeks to solidify the confidentiality of campus emergency response details indefinitely. The scheduled repeal of current exemptions, slated for October 2, 2024, faces potential extinction\u2014suggesting that, once cast in legislative stone, transparency during campus crises may well become a relic of the past.<\/p>\n<p>This proposal has sent tremors through the bedrock of First Amendment advocates and transparency watchdogs alike. The preclusion of automatic legislative review of the secrecy exemptions appears to fundamentally redefine the balance of public safety and the community&#8217;s right to know. Such a measure could set a conceivably dangerous precedent where oversight becomes the exception, not the rule\u2014a pivot that serious proponents of open governance view as antithetical to democratic tenets.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the bill beckons an era where public postsecondary institutions might operate under the cloak of non-disclosure, without the obligation to reassess such policies periodically. What this means for the public, particularly in the event of emergencies that could ripple out into the wider community, is yet unforeseen and concerning.<\/p>\n<p>As advocates for the public&#8217;s right to knowledge decry the proposed changes, it remains to be seen how the halls of power in Florida will respond to the outcry. With the bill slated for effect on October 1, 2024, the arbiters of Florida&#8217;s legal landscape stand on the cusp of a decision that could reshape the ethos of emergency management within the state&#8217;s academic bastions\u2014an outcome that merits the vigilant scrutiny of all who value the intersection of safety, transparency, and trust in public systems.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OGSR\/Campus Emergency Response In a move that has sparked widespread consternation, a recent legislative effort in the Sunshine State is raising the specter of heightened secrecy around postsecondary campus emergencies.
