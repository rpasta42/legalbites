It&#8217;s not a headline-grabbing disaster or a novel virus \u2013 it&#8217;s esophageal cancer, and in Florida, the ticking of the clock has become a resounding alarm. Senate Resolution 118 has spotlighted April 2023 as the month for Floridians to confront what has become an esophageal cancer time bomb. <\/p>\n<p>The Sunshine State is shining a light on a shadowy predator, given the stark revelation that esophageal cancer cases have skyrocketed more than 700 percent among Americans in recent times. It&#8217;s no longer a distant medical rarity but a lethal threat that is the fastest-increasing cancer among American men. What is causing this silent invasion, and how can Floridians combat it?<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, we must face reality: the mortality rates of esophageal cancer are haunting. Only one in five patients live beyond five years post-diagnosis. This grim statistic is largely because this stealthy cancer is often caught in the later stages, leaving patients and clinicians scrambling for effective treatments with time already running out.<\/p>\n<p>But what&#8217;s fueling this increase? Persistent heartburn, more clinically known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is the main culprit behind esophageal cancer in the U.S. Too many evenings of discomfort dismissed as &#8216;just something I ate&#8217; could be the harbinger of something far more insidious.<\/p>\n<p>GERD doesn&#8217;t just ruin a good night&#8217;s sleep; it can lead to Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, a precancerous condition wherein the cells lining the esophagus transform under the assault of stomach acids. This transformation can increase the risk of developing esophageal cancer by up to 30-fold.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s where the beacon of hope shines through \u2013 early detection. Unlike the cancer itself, Barrett&#8217;s esophagus can be eradicated using curative outpatient techniques. This is a call to arms, or rather a call to scopes, as early screening is pivotal in stopping esophageal cancer in its tracks.<\/p>\n<p>April 2023 has become more than just an awareness month; it&#8217;s a turning point for Florida. The resolution isn&#8217;t just about raising the alarm; it&#8217;s an action plan to educate, prevent, detect early, and treat &#8211; all decisive steps that can transform esophageal cancer from a death sentence to a preventable, treatable condition.<\/p>\n<p>In the war against esophageal cancer, knowledge, as always, is power. As Floridians, we need to arm ourselves with awareness because every heartburn could be more than it seems. Health providers need to up their ante, and citizens need to take charge of their health, for every 36 minutes lost is a life too precious to be taken by ignorance. With Senate Resolution 118, Florida is leading the charge against the ticking time bomb of esophageal cancer, and now it&#8217;s our watch, Florida. Let&#8217;s not let another 36 minutes pass in vain.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the clock ticks every 36 minutes, a family in the United States loses a loved one to a killer quietly lurking among us.
