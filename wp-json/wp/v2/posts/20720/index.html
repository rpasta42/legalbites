But a new piece of legal meteorite is streaking through the Florida legislative atmosphere, and it&#8217;s got consumer advocates and privacy warriors alike raising their cosmic shields. The bill in question: Florida Senate Bill 658.<\/p>\n<p>Introducing a galactic shift in legal liability for data breaches, the bill untethers counties, municipalities, and a constellation of commercial entities including sole proprietorships and corporations from legal repercussions, provided they align with specific cybersecurity protocols. These protocols, while robust, raise a critical question: Is the bill a shield for responsible cyber conduct, or an escape pod for entities to dodge accountability?<\/p>\n<p>Picture this: A cyber attack ripples through a company&#8217;s digital defenses, scattering personal data like stardust. But SB 658 says if this entity&#8217;s cybersecurity program is synced up with recognized frameworks\u2014such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology or the International Organization for Standardization\u2014then it&#8217;s as if they&#8217;ve activated some kind of legal deflector shield, potentially leaving consumers in the dark expanse to fend for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Now, tread carefully around the bill&#8217;s &#8216;substantial alignment&#8217; asteroid belt. The term is nebulous, taking into account an entity&#8217;s size and complexity, the nature of its activities, and the sensitivity of information. But with great power comes great responsibility, and entities who claim this alignment must continuously update their defenses within a year of any changes to these cosmic standards.<\/p>\n<p>A collision course is set with controversy as SB 658 declares, in no uncertain terms, that there&#8217;s no private right of action. In plain Earthling language: You, the individual, cannot suit up and sue on the grounds of non-compliance alone. And if you do wave the banner of legal challenge, the entity you&#8217;re aiming for has the burden of proof to demonstrate their alignment with the cyber guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>Before you wrap your head around the implications, know this\u2014ratification of this bill would mean the immediate ignition of its provisions. Data breaches, while as common as shooting stars, could see entities armoring up with legal defenses that prioritize their protection over the consumer&#8217;s right to retribution.<\/p>\n<p>In the cosmic theater of data and liability, Florida Senate Bill 658 may very well become a pivotal scene. Whether it&#8217;s a safeguard for responsible entities or a forcefield that places consumers on the fringe, only time and, possibly, intergalactic debate, will unfold the true nature of this legislative star.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cybersecurity Incident Liability In the digital age, your personal data travels through an ever-expanding cyber universe, potentially falling into the ominous void of data breaches.
