However, Senator Osgood&#8217;s new legal concoction, the Senate Bill 88 (SB 88), aims to stir this pot in a manner that might leave a bittersweet taste, depending on your palate for justice reforms. Dubbed as &#8220;Criminalizing Prejudice: Florida&#8217;s SB 88 or Big Brother&#8217;s Bid?&#8221; our analysis will simmer down the legalese to discern whether it&#8217;s a step toward utopian fairness or an overreach that could stoke the fires of contention.<\/p>\n<p>Diving right into the heart of the matter, SB 88 isn&#8217;t just tweaking the knobs of Florida&#8217;s hate crime statutes\u2014it&#8217;s rebuilding the stove. Crimes motivated by bias aren&#8217;t new to the statute books, but SB 88 seeks to expand the kitchen, so to speak, adding more ingredients such as gender and advanced age to the list of protected classes. The bill is a chef&#8217;s knife, cutting precise definitions: &#8216;race&#8217; now includes hair texture and protective hairstyles like braids and twists, while &#8216;religion&#8217; isn&#8217;t just what you believe but how fervently you practice.<\/p>\n<p>In concrete terms, this bill doesn&#8217;t just label a crime as &#8216;hate-filled&#8217; and call it a day. It serves up a harsher menu of penalties; a mere second-degree misdemeanor could be reclassified to first-degree under its provisions if prejudice is proven to be the bitter herb that seasoned the crime. It&#8217;s a call for a spicier justice system, one that isn&#8217;t afraid to turn the heat up on acts motivated by discrimination.<\/p>\n<p>As tantalizing as the bill&#8217;s promise of tougher action against prejudice might seem, it is not without a whiff of controversy. The inclusion of &#8216;gender&#8217; and &#8216;advanced age&#8217; might be seen by some as an arbitrary garnish\u2014unnecessary flavoring that complicates rather than clarifies. Furthermore, the fresh definition of &#8216;race&#8217; to encapsulate hairstyles has the potential to be a rubbery cut of enforcement, chewy and difficult to digest in practical terms.<\/p>\n<p>But the zest of SB 88 lies in its civil remedy\u2014a sprinkle of hope for those ground down by bias. If you can prove with the substance of clear and convincing evidence that you were coerced or threatened due to prejudice, SB 88 dangles the carrot of treble damages, injunctions, or the dish of your choice from the legal menu. And the cherry on top? Plaintiffs who win their case get a dollop of attorney fees and costs.<\/p>\n<p>This bill does not discriminate in its reach, setting a table for a broad congregation of protected characteristics. As holistic as it sounds, the enforcement of such a wide-spanning bill raises eyebrows\u2014will it over-salt the soup of our legal system with claims hard to prove or refute? Does it risk creating a punitive environment where intent is as murky as a bouillabaisse? The pondering palate wonders.<\/p>\n<p>Should this bill pass, with a scheduled effective date of July 1, 2024, the feast of justice it provides would be a testament to Florida&#8217;s dedication to combating discrimination. Yet, the question remains: is SB 88 the right recipe to nourish the state&#8217;s soul, or are we risking a case of indigestion in our legal system? Whether a step toward inclusive protection or a case of legislative overreach, one thing&#8217;s for sure\u2014SB 88 stands as a big, bold move in Florida&#8217;s legal cookbook. We&#8217;ll keep an eye on the pot as it continues to simmer in the legislative kitchen.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Crimes Evidencing Prejudice As Floridians, we often pride ourselves on the state&#8217;s rich tapestry of cultures and ideals\u2014a veritable melting pot under the sun.
