Senate Bill 278, sponsored by Senator Martin, is threatening to upend the financial status quo for community associations by banishing one of their subtle yet steady revenue streams. If you&#8217;re part of an HOA, condominium, or cooperative, pour that morning coffee and pay attention\u2014this could hit your wallet harder than a hurricane.<\/p>\n<p>At the heart of the controversy is the unassuming estoppel certificate. These critical documents tell the tale of a property&#8217;s good standing\u2014or financial floundering\u2014within a community association at moments crucial for selling or refinancing. Currently, associations can charge for these certificates, offsetting administrative costs. Not small change, the fee is like a vigilant sentinel guarding the financial fortress of an HOA&#8217;s operations.<\/p>\n<p>Enter SB 278, the game-changer that could potentially swing the gates wide open, denying HOAs the right to levy any fees for drafting and doling out these financial fact sheets. With the stroke of a legislative pen, associations may soon have to bear the cost burden themselves, a stark shift from the days of charging for these time-consuming documents. <\/p>\n<p>While associations might wave farewell to this income lane, proponents of the bill hail it as a pro-consumer champion, driving down the costs for those navigating the already choppy waters of property transactions. The proposed changes to sections 718.116, 719.108, and 720.30851 of the Florida Statutes stamp out fee-related wording like a bonfire extinguished by a monsoon.<\/p>\n<p>Further stiffening the bill&#8217;s sails, community associations would be compelled to issue estoppel certificates within 10 business days upon request. No dilly-dallying allowed. Moreover, associations must elect a specific person or entity to handle requests, which might sound like good governance, but for many, it&#8217;s additional red tape\u2014and cost\u2014without compensation.<\/p>\n<p>The estoppel certificates wouldn&#8217;t slim down in content, though. They&#8217;d still be chock-full of necessary numbers: from unpaid assessments and due dates to attorney contact info in case of default. In short, everything but the kitchen sink about a unit&#8217;s financial relationship with its association is laid bare. What&#8217;s off the table now? Provisions allowing for extra admin fees, even as the trials and tribulations of inflation continue, unbidden and unchecked.<\/p>\n<p>How does the bill sit within the Floridian legal landscape? Is it spotlight-worthy? According to the bill&#8217;s acknowledgments, it&#8217;s heralded as a headline dominator for its potential impact on both consumer pockets and HOA budgets. But not all spotlights are kind, for the bill also hits the hard dirt of controversy.<\/p>\n<p>Casting the ability to charge fees into the legislative abyss might trigger financial instability for associations. The removal of fee adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index? That&#8217;s akin to ignoring the creeping costs of services in an ever-inflating economy\u2014a potentially dangerous oversight for community associations&#8217; balance sheets.<\/p>\n<p>If the bill traverses the legislative labyrinth and comes into law, it&#8217;ll kick in on July 1, 2024. That gives community associations a window to batten down the hatches before the economic gale hits home.<\/p>\n<p>As Floridians, we&#8217;re no strangers to preparing for the winds of change; it&#8217;s now up to community associations and property owners alike to chart a course through the potential fiscal squall of SB 278. Stay tuned, stay informed, and more importantly\u2014stay financially sound.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Estoppel Certificates **Florida&#8217;s New Bill Could Bankrupt Your HOA: Here&#8217;s How** In the Sunshine State, a legal storm could be looming for homeowners&#8217; associations (HOAs) across the peninsula.
