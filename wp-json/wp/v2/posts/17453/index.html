The latest to hit the State Senate floor, Senate Resolution 1740, doesn&#8217;t merely acknowledge an educational institution; it seemingly elevates one particularly to the expanse of public adoration. <\/p>\n<p>Labeling April 19, 2023, as &#8220;Keiser University Day,\u201d Senator Collins&#8217; sponsorship steers a spotlight onto the university as it nears its golden jubilee. This day beckons a statewide celebration of the institution&#8217;s lauded impact and contributions over almost half a century. Honors are often distributed for outstanding service and societal contributions, however, can the same sentiment hold when policy appears to signify favoritism or an agenda-driven endorsement?<\/p>\n<p>The resolution unearths raw data heralding Keiser University&#8217;s prominence. It is indeed impressive that this institution prides itself on a top rank for upward social mobility by no less an authority than the U.S. News &#038; World Report for 2023. With an armory of 100+ degree programs targeting Florida\u2019s critical workforce sectors, such as healthcare and technology, Keiser University genuinely seems to hit the educational target dead center.<\/p>\n<p>However, beneath the surface sheen, some observe with caution as this bill could be perceived as interweaving government preference within the free-market education system. When a legislative body zeroes in on the private university sector, some constituents may question if this borders on undue partiality. Promoting the institution for its workforce contributions, especially across cybersecurity, AI, and homeland security, veers close to espousing a singular narrative of superior education outside the realms of public scrutiny.<\/p>\n<p>Digging further into the fabric of Keiser\u2019s portfolio reveals its substantial contribution to producing nursing professionals. More than 3,200 nursing graduates over just five years is no mean feat in a sector constantly crying out for more professionals.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, educational institutions should stick out for their educational prowess, not political favor. So why does the Senate seek to cement Keiser University&#8217;s achievements with a statewide day in its honor? While there&#8217;s no direct evidence of Keiser University advancing political views or agenda through its platform, the resolution&#8217;s timing and emphasis lends itself to heightened contemplation about the implications of public policy mingling with private educational entities.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the resolution applauds the retention of Keiser\u2019s graduates within the Sunshine State\u2014approximately 85 percent remain to work and live in Florida post-graduation. Is this an example of a symbiotic success story, or does it hint at an insular approach to statewide educational growth?<\/p>\n<p>The spectrum of Keiser\u2019s student body, composed of military affiliates, Hispanic students, and a dominant female percentage, paints a picture of diversity and inclusion, a vital quality for any institution claiming to gear its students towards the global marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the dedication of Keiser personnel, from Chancellor Dr. Arthur Keiser to its faculty, ought not to go unnoticed. But the resolution reads as a shiny brochure for the institution, raising the question: what becomes of education when it steps off the campus and slips into the realms of legislation?<\/p>\n<p>As the debate swirls around the intent and impact of Florida&#8217;s newest bill, what is apparent is the need for public discourse on the role of educational institutions within the political sphere. It is critical to discern, through the fanfare, if we are celebrating education or unwittingly promoting an indoctrination of sorts\u2014a preference to one, while others toil in its shadow. This resolution might be headlined-worthy, but the substantiated dialogues it triggers are, without doubt, society-defining.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Keiser University Day Florida stands at a crossroads between academic accolades and the whispers of indoctrination as it introduces a legal bill that\u2019s causing quite a stir among its citizens.
