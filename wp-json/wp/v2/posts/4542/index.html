Florida&#8217;s SB 128, cloaked in the mantle of consumer protection, may instead become a suit of armor for financial predators. This bill, asserting to amend existing laws related to consumer debt collection, attempts to thread the needle between shielding victims and potentially granting their exploiters a safe harbor.<\/p>\n<p>SB 128 introduces a perplexing paradox: a new section, 559.721, designed to prevent creditors from contacting debtors under certain conditions. While this might sound like a compassionate gesture towards individuals who&#8217;ve suffered elder and economic abuse, human trafficking, identity theft, and the exploitation of vulnerable adults, the implications run deeper and darker than they appear.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s clarify the vernacular first\u2014under SB 128, a &#8216;creditor&#8217; is pinpointed as a person who must be registered in accordance with section 559.553 of the Florida Statutes. This registration becomes the trojan horse; what if those who engage in predatory tactics discreetly meet these requirements? Would they then be bestowed the power to operate with immunity under the guise of legitimacy?<\/p>\n<p>The bill also empowers the Office of Financial Regulation of the Financial Services Commission to act as the guardian of consumer complaints, informing the appropriate regulatory bodies of alleged violations. Although this duty aims to knight the regulatory body as the protector of consumer rights, one cannot overlook that bureaucracy often moves slower than exploitation. How many victims might fall through the cracks while the sluggish wheels of bureaucracy turn?<\/p>\n<p>While SB 128 nobly allows debtors to unsheathe their legal swords in civil actions against creditors who cross the line, this right comes at the end of a gauntlet that many already vulnerable citizens may feel ill-equipped to navigate. The process of proving violation, not to mention facing a registered creditor in court, can be likened to sending a lamb into a lion&#8217;s den.<\/p>\n<p>And what about the penalties? For violators caught in the act, the law specifies damages, costs, and fees. However, one must ask if these punitive measures are but a slap on the wrist for these financial mercenaries, considering the potential profits from their predatory schemes.<\/p>\n<p>SB 128 is poised to come into effect on July 1, 2023. However, its true impact on Floridian justice remains an unnervingly open question. Will it indeed serve as a bulwark for the harassed debtor, or will it successfully mask the machinations of financial exploitation? The law, much like a double-edged sword, holds the potential both to defend and to wound deeply. As July approaches, vigilant eyes will watch this bill, wary of a legislative wolf in sheep&#8217;s clothing that could shield financial predators from justice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the Sunshine State, a bill is casting a long shadow over the rights of financial abuse victims.
