March 2023 has been designated as &#8216;Chronic Kidney Disease Awareness Month&#8217; in Florida, and the spotlight is now turn toward a startling truth: over 37 million adults in the United States are estimated to be in CKD&#8217;s stealthy grip and alarmingly, most are treading in the dark about their condition. <\/p>\n<p>The facts are stark and unsettling. Ninety percent of individuals with CKD from stages 1 to 3 are blissfully unaware until the disease has advanced, causing irreversible damage. The African American populous, an already underserved demographic, stands out due to a jarring statistic\u2014fewer than 3 percent believe they are at high risk. The disparity is not just startling; it\u2019s appalling. <\/p>\n<p>African Americans face nearly fourfold the risk of kidney failure compared to their white counterparts, while Hispanics sit at a 1.3 times higher likelihood. The roots of inequality deepen with the revelation that in 2010, science shed light on a genetic component largely responsible for the CKD divide. Two variants of the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene have been linked to a significantly increased risk of kidney disease, a factor alarmingly common (13 percent prevalence) among African Americans. Carrying this genetic marker is akin to walking a tightrope without a safety net, quickening the descent into kidney dysfunction, as indicated by symptoms like proteinuria (excessive protein in the urine), swelling, fatigue, and weight gain.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the grim picture, the resolution doesn\u2019t leave us without solace or direction. It brings hope in the guise of simple diagnostic measures such as blood and urine tests, and in the genetic test for APOL1 risk variants, affirming that detection isn\u2019t out of reach\u2014it\u2019s a matter of awareness and action. The call to arms is clear: close the gap in diagnosis and introduce community-level programs that tailor their fight against CKD to the needs of those most at risk.<\/p>\n<p>In wrapping up, Senate Resolution 1742 doesn\u2019t just mark the calendar for awareness; it\u2019s a rallying cry for communities of color to partake in the urgent endeavor of managing CKD. As &#8216;Chronic Kidney Disease Awareness Month&#8217; is recognized, let&#8217;s join hands in fortifying our defenses against this threat by promoting early detection, advocating for equal treatment opportunities, and educating those standing in the perilous shadow of CKD. <\/p>\n<p>This is more than a legal directive; it&#8217;s a lifeline. It&#8217;s a beacon of hope to prevent the tragedies that too often unfold when a disease like CKD remains hidden in plain sight. The call for awareness extends beyond the halls of legislation\u2014it&#8217;s an urgent alert for action in the homes and hearts of our communities, one we can&#8217;t afford to ignore.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Chronic Kidney Disease Awareness Month Urgent Alert for People of Color: The Kidney Danger You Can&#8217;t Afford to Ignore In a powerful move to confront a silent health adversary, Senator Powell has underscored the gravity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with the introduction of Senate Resolution 1742, bringing critical attention to a condition that nefariously [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":17456,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1486],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.5 -
