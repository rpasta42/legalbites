A bill urging a dramatic reversal has come charging out of Florida, and it concerns one of America&#8217;s key allies: Colombia.<\/p>\n<p>Colombia isn&#8217;t just any partner; it&#8217;s a veteran in the democratic lineup of Latin America\u2014a region often beleaguered by the vagaries of autocracy and instability. The ties between the U.S. and Colombia have historically been akin to a lighthouse in a troubled sea, showcasing a beacon of joint commitment to fighting the dark tidal forces of narcotics and terrorism.<\/p>\n<p>What we have here, according to advocates for the bill, is a seismic shift that could potentially rock U.S.-Latin American relations. The bill notes with disquiet that the Biden Administration, in December 2021, struck off the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) from the U.S. list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations\u2014organizations that pose a significant threat to American interests and security.<\/p>\n<p>But why the uproar now? Well, get ready to plunge into the history books. Florida&#8217;s legislature isn\u2019t just concerned with the state&#8217;s oranges and tourism; it&#8217;s casting a steely eye at the heritage of blood and violence that FARC has left in its wake. The bill pulls no punches in detailing FARC&#8217;s litany of heinous acts: murder, torture, kidnappings\u2014pictures that rip apart the fabric of any notion of human rights.<\/p>\n<p>Some may say FARC is defunct, a relic of a peace deal inked in 2016, but others warn that these militants still cast long shadows. They argue that the bill taps into a vein of reality that demands attention: FARC&#8217;s so-called dissidents remain active, their ideals bubbling in lethal undercurrents, threatening Colombia&#8217;s thriving democracy and vibrant free market.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, Senate Memorial 160 isn&#8217;t just local legislation beating its chest; it embodies trade, security, and human dignity. This isn&#8217;t just about the State of Florida; it&#8217;s about the lives, the economy, and the future of Colombian citizens, their fight against the oppressive Maduro regime in Venezuela, and their long-standing partnership with Uncle Sam.<\/p>\n<p>So the bill stands, feet firmly planted, opposing the federal government&#8217;s stance and embodying the resilience of Florida\u2019s legislature\u2014a body resolute in bolstering security, prosperity, and democratic values in this fraught geopolitical dance. Senate Memorial 160 sends a clarion call to the United States Secretary of State: Redesignate FARC as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. It&#8217;s not just a request; it&#8217;s a grasp for the moral compass in a region where North and South desperately need to find their magnetic alignment.<\/p>\n<p>A copy of this memorial lands like a splash in the grand corridors of Washington, demanding attention from the highest seats of national power. The message? Reassess, rethink, and recognize the very real threat that shadows like FARC cast upon the democratic canvas of our hemisphere.<\/p>\n<p>Is the U.S., as the bill implies, coddling terrorists? The conversation is only just beginning, but Senate Memorial 160 intends to make sure that it&#8217;s a debate that won&#8217;t fade quietly into the political background.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Redesignation of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization In an unexpected twist of U.S. foreign policy, Senate Memorial 160 raises the alarm over a matter of fierce debate and potential danger: Are we turning a blind eye to terrorism?
