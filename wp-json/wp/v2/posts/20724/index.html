Brace yourself, because if you&#8217;re not parked in your charging dock, your wallet might be in for a shockwave. In a stunning move, the Florida House Bill 661 (HB 661) is zipping through the legislative lanes and might just triple your EV storage costs overnight!<\/p>\n<p>The bill, which is revving up to take effect on July 1, 2024, is amping up the regulations for wrecker operators and storage facilities, but it&#8217;s the electric car community that could feel the jolt. Here&#8217;s the high-voltage issue: the legislation requires counties to crank up the maximum rates for storing EVs to at least three times the rate of gas guzzlers. Yeah, you read that right \u2014 triple!<\/p>\n<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more voltage. The bill isn&#8217;t just about tapping your wallet; it&#8217;s about controlling the hazardous waste cleanup after a shunt. According to the new legal landscape, wrecker operators can add a 10% surcharge on top of &#8220;reasonable costs&#8221; for dealing with EV-related hazardous materials or debris. And let&#8217;s face it: when we&#8217;re talking EV batteries, the term &#8220;hazardous&#8221; gets tossed around as much as coins into a toll booth.<\/p>\n<p>Switching gears to the second amendment in HB 661, let\u2019s talk about getting stranded in the paperwork if your ride gets towed. Usually, if your vehicle\u2019s cozying up in the wrecker&#8217;s lot for over 30 days, it&#8217;s a tug-of-war between you and the storage facility. But the bill hits the brakes on that \u2014 after that 30-day mark, the entity that pointed a hook at your car is the one in charge of the storage tab. This might sound like a winner, but it could steer into a conflict lane with agencies not keen on these charges.<\/p>\n<p>And if your EV ends up abandoned longer than a lunch break at a South Beach caf\u00e9, the legislature&#8217;s got a new roadmap for that, too. No more old-school newspaper ads for Johnny Law when they need to offload unclaimed vehicles. HB 661 is cruising the digital highway, allowing for sales notices to roll out on a central database or online platform rubber-stamped by the motor vehicle department. Talk about a direct upload.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve got to admit, at its core, HB 661&#8217;s battery is charged with good intentions \u2014 addressing environmental concerns and clarifying who&#8217;s paying what in the EV towing world. But let&#8217;s unplug and decode the fine print: this piece of legislative tech could be seen by some as a controversial surge against EV owners, sporting a bit of that &#8216;discriminatory or punitive&#8217; vibe.<\/p>\n<p>The coming months will be a real road test for HB 661 as it generates both sparks of support and static from critics. For EV owners cruising the Sunshine State, it might be time to buckle up \u2014 you&#8217;re in for an electrifying ride through the twists and turns of the legal landscape. Stay tuned and stay connected, because when it comes to Florida&#8217;s new driving direction, you want to have all your gadgets fully charged and ready.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wrecker Operators Are you an electric vehicle (EV) owner in sunny Florida?
