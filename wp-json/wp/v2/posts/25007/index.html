However, the latest legal proposition from Florida&#8217;s legislative cogs is stirring up a tempest on the shores of common sense and legal rigor. The vehicle for this potential upheaval? Florida House Bill 713 (HB 713). Slated for action in 2024, this bill is locked and loaded to redefine the landscape of personal offenses, promising to lay down the law with a heavy hand\u2014quite literally putting the &#8216;felon&#8217; in &#8216;felony for fluids.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Currently, Florida Statutes paint battery with a relatively narrow brush, targeting cases involving minors and certain bodily substances. But the reimagined Section 784.085 underlined by HB 713 is casting a wider net, snaring adults in an expanded definition of battery. One that not only frowns upon but criminalizes the voluntary catapulting of blood, seminal fluid, or urine or feces when it&#8217;s thrown, tossed, projected, or expelled at another.<\/p>\n<p>The revised legal texts lay it out in no uncertain terms: do the crime, face a third-degree felony time. And it&#8217;s not just a slap on the wrist. We&#8217;re talking about real consequences, as outlined in sections s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084 of the Florida Statutes. But wait, there&#8217;s a twist. The controversial amendment adds layers of complexity by switching out &#8216;child&#8217; for &#8216;person&#8217;\u2014an alteration that may ignite a firestorm of debate.<\/p>\n<p>The bill&#8217;s authors put forward a valiant argument, one of unyielding resolve aimed at protecting the public from the wilful sharing of bodily substances that, quite frankly, nobody asked for. It&#8217;s a health issue, they say. Such unwelcome encounters are often dinghies carrying a flotilla of pathogens, dancing their way to a new host. But do the punitive measures fit the crime? Or better yet, do they fit the time\u2014our time\u2014where context seems to be king?<\/p>\n<p>On one hand, this legislative leviathan throws down a gauntlet, signaling zero tolerance for acts that might be seen as defiant nose-thumbing in the face of public health and personal consent. It champions the cause of public safety, heralding a new era of legal hygiene wherein nefarious fluid-flinging is met with the iron fist of the justice system.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, this bold legislative step could be doing the legal foxtrot on a tightrope stretched over a canyon of controversy. Critics argue that the slip &#8216;n slide from unlawful deeds involving children to one encompassing all persons is a step too far. The unsettling question echoes in the halls of jurisprudence: should a one-size-fits-all felony be the costume we choose for a spectrum of offenses that could, in some cases, be accidental, or at least, neutrally intentional?<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, in the court of public opinion, the ambiguous verbiage might stoke the fires of discord. Is a sneeze at the wrong place and time now a launchpad for criminal charges? Will the accidental cocktail party wine spill be subject bystander to felony charges if some of it was more bodily than the vineyard intended? Such possibilities hang ominously over the heads of Floridians like the proverbial Sword of Damocles.<\/p>\n<p>As the bill&#8217;s enactment date looms on the horizon like some judicial juggernaut, attention turns to lawmakers and the populace alike. Will the hotbed of opinion boil over into legal revision, or will Florida stand firmly by its conviction that harsher penalties are the cure for society&#8217;s maladies\u2014even those potentially accidental or misinterpreted?<\/p>\n<p>As the clock ticks toward October 1, 2024, we can only watch, wait, and wonder. Will HB 713 be the dawn of a new legal era, or will it end up a footnote in the annals of well-meaning but overreaching legislative attempts? Only time, the ultimate judge, will tell.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Battery Offenses In the Sunshine State, lawmakers aren&#8217;t throwing in the towel when it comes to beefing up legal protection against battery.
