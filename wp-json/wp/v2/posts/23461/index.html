With the enactment of House Bill 7035, the Sunshine State is sparking intense debates about the trade-offs between privacy and transparency, especially when it comes to public entities like the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (CPIC). But with public trust on the line, Floridians are asking: Is this level of secrecy justified or is Florida hiding cybersecurity secrets from its citizens?<\/p>\n<p>The bill, which sailed through legislative channels and came into effect on October 1, 2023, breaks from tradition and grants CPIC a blanket exemption from revealing detailed information about its cybersecurity operations. Under the guises of security, it shields what was once accessible under the state&#8217;s robust public records laws\u2014risk assessments, evaluations, audits, and more\u2014on the grounds that sharing them could hand hackers the keys to the kingdom.<\/p>\n<p>As a domain expert, I can&#8217;t help but notice the bill&#8217;s departure from the norm. HB 7035 modifies Section 627.352 of the Florida Statutes in ways that change the balance between confidentiality and the public&#8217;s right to information. It carves out an opaque corner within CPIC where discussions of the corporation&#8217;s information technology security program are tucked away from public scrutiny.<\/p>\n<p>The bill&#8217;s proponents argue that such moves are necessary. In a world where cybersecurity incidents can compromise the personal data of millions and disrupt the economy at the drop of a hat, isn&#8217;t it prudent to keep your defense secrets safe from prying eyes? And indeed, the bill does not leave the records shrouded entirely in mystery; select officials and agencies still have a peep through the curtain, ostensibly for security and regulatory purposes.<\/p>\n<p>However, the plot thickens with HB 7035&#8217;s bold move to eliminate its own sunset clause. Previously, like many legal exemptions, it would be subjected to regular review, subject to potential repeal if not proven necessary. But now, with no automatic expiry date, this cloaked approach to cybersecurity is set to linger indefinitely on Florida&#8217;s legal stage. Critics pounce on this point, concerned that it seals shut a door that ought to remain ajar for accountability&#8217;s sake.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a quandary of governance\u2014how do you strike a balance between safeguarding sensitive data and enabling the public&#8217;s oversight? While HB 7035 states that the exempted meetings must be recorded and transcribed, it simultaneously orders these records to be kept under lock and key, only to be revealed if a court sifts through and finds non-confidential dialogue worth public consumption. <\/p>\n<p>The underpinning controversy hinges on whether this bill is an overcorrection. Does its enactment pivot too far from the principles of open government, leaving Floridians in the dark about their largest public insurance provider&#8217;s cybersecurity measures? The concern is not baseless, as CPIC operates in the realm of public trust, handling matters of property insurance. The implications of such operations are enormous for both public safety and fiscal health.<\/p>\n<p>In the grand chess game of cybersecurity, HB 7035 indeed slides the queen to guard the king, but in doing so, it may prompt the citizens to wonder what moves are being hidden from their view. With this bill, Florida redraws the line between security and transparency. But are these the right shades to paint the future of public cybersecurity? Only time\u2014and perhaps a few court orders\u2014will reveal if Floridians are right to ask if cyber secrets are indeed being withheld from them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OGSR\/Citizens Property Insurance Corporation\/Cybersecurity Data and Information In a digital era, where cyber-threats loom larger than ever, Florida is tightening the veil of secrecy surrounding its cybersecurity practices.
