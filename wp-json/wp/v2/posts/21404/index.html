House Bill 777 (HB 777) has introduced a swirling vortex of controversy and debate into the placid waters of the Florida Legislature. This isn&#8217;t just a drop in the bucket; the proposed amendment to section 180.191 of the Florida Statutes could dramatically alter the landscape of how municipalities operate water or sewer utilities.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, the powers-that-be within Florida&#8217;s municipalities can tack on a surcharge of up to 25% on the water bills of consumers living outside their boundaries. And they&#8217;ve been able to do this without convening a public hearing, provided these surcharges mirror the parameters set for internal customers, capping at a total excess of 50% compared to the rates internal consumers are charged. It&#8217;s a discretionary power that has been flowing without much resistance\u2014until now.<\/p>\n<p>Outrage has bubbled up from those on the outskirts who are tired of being soaked by what they view as unfair surcharges. Enter HB 777. This bill isn&#8217;t just a minor adjustment to the status quo but a proposed tidal wave of change that seeks to eliminate these controversial surcharges without a public hearing. Instead, the bill proposes that any new rates, fees, or charges, including changes to existing ones, must go through the transparent and democratic process of a public hearing. This ensures that voices of the affected consumers, including property owners, tenants, and all other &#8216;interested parties,&#8217; will have their day in the public forum to pour out their concerns and opinions. It&#8217;s a move towards a more equitable system, where the decision-making isn&#8217;t done in a vacuum, but rather in the full view of those it impacts the most.<\/p>\n<p>But the line in the sand \u2014 or should we say sediment \u2014 doesn&#8217;t stop there. HB 777 also takes a deep dive into the future, mandating a comprehensive rate study to be done by January 1, 2027, and every seven years after that. The intent is to ensure that all charges are justified and equitable, holding these utilities accountable for their rates and preventing them from draining consumers&#8217; wallets unfairly.<\/p>\n<p>However, municipal governments aren&#8217;t letting this slide by without stirring the pot. The idea of relinquishing that bounty of 25% surcharge without a fight could leave them feeling parched for funds. Moreover, subjecting themselves to public scrutiny every time they wish to adjust rates, not to mention carrying out detailed rate studies every seven years, paints a picture of future headaches and financial drains they&#8217;d rather avoid.<\/p>\n<p>This policy change could prove to be a watershed moment for municipalities that have fluidly benefited from the additional revenue stream the surcharge provides. The proposed operational and financial burden of the recurring rate studies is yet another turbulent current pulling at the anchors of their financial planning.<\/p>\n<p>As for the verdict, it&#8217;s still out. Should HB 777 be passed, it will flood into effect on July 1, 2024, potentially heralding a new era of fairness and transparency in municipal water and sewer utilities. Whatever the outcome, this bill is a headline-worthy downpour of debate that has Floridians everywhere paying attention to the financial streams flowing from their taps. Will citizens be relieved from the pressure of hidden fees? Or will this legislative maneuver lead to a drought in municipal funds? Stay tuned as we continue to immerse ourselves in the evolving saga of Florida&#8217;s water wars.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Municipal Water or Sewer Utility Rates, Fees, and Charges As Floridians turn on their faucets, they may unknowingly be at the center of a heated legal dispute that&#8217;s sending ripples through communities far and wide.
