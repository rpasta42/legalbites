House Bill 247, a bill that seems benignly aimed at updating Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles protocols, packs an unexpected punch when it comes to inheriting your family&#8217;s vintage roadster or even that trusty family van.<\/p>\n<p>First on the docket is a curious change to the way heirs can claim their mechanical inheritances. According to the nitty-gritty of HB 247, if Grandpa leaves you his beloved Cadillac in his will, your path to cruising in his memory just got easier. An affidavit from a Florida lawyer is all you need to cruise past probate, so long as it states you are the rightful wheel-holder. No more trudging through the legalese jungle with the will in hand!<\/p>\n<p>However, don&#8217;t start your engines just yet. Some eagle-eyed scrimmagers are waving the yellow flag on this play. Without the need for a copy of the will, the transfer process could become a hotbed of misunderstanding\u2014or even calculated misuse. Will this lead to a spike in inheritance disputes? It surely isn&#8217;t what Grandpa had in mind for his prized roadster.<\/p>\n<p>In another twist, Florida drivers who&#8217;ve lost their title to the void of undelivered mail have reason to raise their glasses. HB 247 brings them a little sunshine: no more fee for a reissued title if the original joins the ranks of the missing within 180 days. A small victory, but for anyone who&#8217;s played the waiting game with critical documents, it&#8217;s a godsend.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t blink or you&#8217;ll miss the bill&#8217;s nod to the not-so-big rigs. The DHSMV may soon be minting pint-sized license plates to suit the smaller backends of trailers. While this makes sense practically, aesthetically, the jury&#8217;s still out on whether Floridians will embrace mini plates.<\/p>\n<p>Catch your breath before we dive into a change that&#8217;s been causing a stir with our nation&#8217;s heroes. DHSMV&#8217;s show of gratitude to disabled veterans who, until now, have had to rock the &#8220;DV&#8221; tag for specific perks, broadens their choices. With HB 247, they could land a military or specialty license plate, still sans certain fees. The catch? These plates strip away some privileges and accessibility symbols previously associated with the &#8220;DV&#8221; designation. Some veteran groups are already lining up to debate, wary of any move that hints at diluting benefits held dear by those who&#8217;ve served.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, for everyone&#8217;s E-ZPass in the era of motor bureaucracy, HB 247 aims to simplify the ordeal of snagging a temporary tag. The new bill straight up dismisses the old requirement for a written, notarized request for temp tag renewal. Florida drivers may soon say goodbye to round two with red tape.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re an heir to a family jalopy, a stickler for service and documentation, or a vet with a plate preference, HB 247 is driving conversations, and perhaps controversy, across the Sunshine State. Bracing for a July 1st, 2024 start date, this proposed act is sliding onto Florida&#8217;s legislative stage with all the subtlety of a muscle car at a library. As it revs up to possibly change gears on Florida&#8217;s legal landscape, keep your eyes on this legal lane\u2014your inheritance could be cruising on cruise control or heading for a pit stop.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Services Provided by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or Its Agents In the world of Wills and Wheels, the Florida State Legislature rolled out a legislative bombshell that could have you scratching your head about your legacy on wheels.
