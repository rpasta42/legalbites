This controversial bill, presented by Senator Wright, signals a U-turn in the way motor vehicle transactions are handled, with far-reaching implications. But is Florida cruising towards consumer protection paradise, or veering off into dealership despair?<\/p>\n<p>At its core, Senate Bill 1636 lays down a new road map for when and how a car sale can be rescinded or canceled, but only if all parties, including any lienholders, sign off on the decision. According to the bill, this exit ramp from a car deal is available up to 30 days following the date of sale. Sounds like a fair deal? Buckle up; the ride&#8217;s about to get bumpier.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no question that having a clear process can be a cushion for both parties if the wheels fall off a car sale. But what about those high-commitment scenarios where applications have been filed or taxes and fees have already been paid? That&#8217;s where it gets tricky. The dealer will be in a race against time to certify the cancellation and wind back the odometer on all the paperwork, all within a tight 15-day window.<\/p>\n<p>While this may give some buyers a safety net should buyers&#8217; remorse kick in or defects drive into the picture, some argue that such freedom to reverse course could make dealers hesitant to hand over the keys so quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Dig a little deeper and you find that the bill has some acceleration: once the rescission form hits the desks of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, they have just 7 days to hit the brakes on the transaction and issue a refund of most fees and taxes to the dealer. And there&#8217;s more\u2014dealers can&#8217;t even pump the sales pedal on a returned vehicle until the DHSMV crowns them with a brand-new title reflecting the dealer&#8217;s name and the car&#8217;s odometer reading at the time of the exit.<\/p>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s explore one of those controversial references tucked under the hood: the requirement for all parties to concur could steer negotiations into rough terrain. Imagine a lienholder with claims on the vehicle eyeing a different horizon. One could argue that this creates a gridlock of interests, potentially leaving buyers and dealers stranded on the negotiation highway.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, this isn&#8217;t just about canceling sales; it influences the entire drivescape of dealership finances and operations. Not to mention, even if a sale is put in reverse, it&#8217;s still counted as a sale. That might sound like revving the engine without shifting gears, but it&#8217;s an important detail when considering the lifecycle of the vehicle and its impact on both market data and inventory turnover.<\/p>\n<p>In effect on July 1, 2023, should it pass into law, this bill doesn&#8217;t just transform the private sale bill of sale\u2014it&#8217;s poised to redefine the entire landscape of car buying in Florida. Whether this will be a boon for buyer confidence or a mechanic\u2019s wrench in the gears of automotive commerce remains a story that, for now, is still coasting towards its conclusion. Keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the legal dashboard\u2014Florida&#8217;s car market is about to get interesting.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rescission or Cancellation of a Motor Vehicle Sale Tensions are revving up in the Sunshine State as car buyers and dealers face potentially hazardous legal potholes, thanks to the introduction of Florida Senate Bill 1636.
