They call it Florida House Bill 525 (2024), and it&#8217;s not just stirring the waters\u2014it&#8217;s a veritable contractor liability tsunami. But before you grab your floaties, let&#8217;s plunge into what this bill means for the residents and builders of the Sunshine State.<\/p>\n<p>The bill, structured to soak in on July 1, 2024, is no puddle\u2014it&#8217;s an overhaul of the existing legal framework surrounding pool and spa construction. In its depths are amendments that broaden the scope of work for whom else but the masons of our backyard oases: the commercial and residential pool\/spa contractors, not to mention those who tend to their aftercare, the swimming pool\/spa servicing contractors.<\/p>\n<p>Diving deeper, we find that commercial pool\/spa contractors are witnessing their horizons expanded broader than the expansive Florida horizon. These artisans can now legally perform an array of tasks from the ground up, like erecting equipment rooms, excavation, dewatering, all the way to the delicate art of applying interior finishes. They are, however, keeping their hands clean of major plumbing and electrical work, as the bill clarifies their boundaries by excluding direct connections to sanitary and water lines, as well as major panel or circuit tasks.<\/p>\n<p>Swimming alongside, their compatriots in residential construction find their duties mirroring the commercial crews, albeit with a caveat: They can&#8217;t venture into new commercial or public waters, leaving that arena to their commercial counterparts. Trust the servicing contractors to breathe new life into pools and spas, with an expanded definition smoothing the way for extensive draining activities previously beyond their ken.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, what bill would make a ripple without touching on the money matters? This legislation defines new financial ground rules with a fortified recovery fund\u2014a safety net guarding property owners against drowning in the off-chance a construction project goes belly-up or fails to meet the mark. A snug buoy in the form of a $50,000 per-contract maximum payout for Division II claims against pool and spa mavens begins to float from January 1, 2025, for contracts inked after the summer solstice of 2024. For any lone Division II licensee, a $500,000 cap is the pool fence around the recovery fund, emphasizing controlled diving only.<\/p>\n<p>The undercurrent of this bill is crystal clear: it aims to safeguard the client while ensuring contractors don&#8217;t dip their toes over the line. It&#8217;s a balance\u2014a push and pull between consumer protection and contractor due diligence. But as with any shift in the tides, controversy stirs beneath these calm waters.<\/p>\n<p>The swell in financial cap for recovery claims, rising dramatically from a cozy $15,000 to a sizable $50,000, could splash contractors with cold water, making them wary of the increased liability. Meanwhile, the expanded contractor definitions themselves might create whirlpools of regulation and oversight quandaries, making it anyone&#8217;s guess as to how the industry will swim with these new currents.<\/p>\n<p>Florida&#8217;s &#8216;Swim at Your Own Risk&#8217; Bill marks the emergence of a new era of accountability and consumer protection in the construction industry. With change on the horizon, all eyes will be on Florida as it sets the raft for contractor-consumer relations, floating a blueprint that could ripple across the nation. As this legislative life raft is cast into the waters of the state statute, everyone from homeowners to hard-hatted builders will have to adjust their strokes to keep swimming in Florida&#8217;s evolving sea of legal responsibility.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Swimming Pool and Spa Contractors With Florida&#8217;s sparkling pools and tranquil spas dotting the landscape across the sunny state, a new legal tide is rising that&#8217;s set to splash the construction industry with a wave of change.
