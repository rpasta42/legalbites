Senator Burton is pioneering Florida Senate Bill 1676, an ambitious attempt to rope in a new era for the Sunshine State&#8217;s industrial hemp program \u2013 a bill dense with implications that are stirring both anticipation and anxiety among cannabis connoisseurs and critics alike.<\/p>\n<p>Florida&#8217;s hemp greenscape is poised for a revolution if SB 1676 takes root, promising to redefine what qualifies as &#8216;food&#8217; within its legal code. Imagine strolling through your local supermarket and finding &#8216;hemp extract&#8217; cozily labeled alongside everyday staples like bread and milk. This bill proposes just that, weaving &#8216;hemp extract&#8217; into the very fabric of Florida&#8217;s definition of food. But don&#8217;t be fooled by its benign appearance on shelves \u2013 the legislation insists on strict agricultural babysitting, mandating time and temperature controls to ensure these products maintain their integrity and safety from farm to fork.<\/p>\n<p>Amidst the chatter and clatter about cannabinoids, SB 1676 clarifies that as long as hemp-derived products play by the rules, they&#8217;re no outlaws \u2013 not deemed controlled substances or adulterants. The catch? A &#8216;no entry&#8217; sign has been put up for synthetically derived cannabinoids, signalling a significant line drawn in the sandy beaches of Florida&#8217;s legal terrain. The &#8216;hemp extract&#8217; under SB 1676&#8217;s watchful eye must be purely extracted from Mother Nature&#8217;s hemp and meet meticulous standards to earn its title.<\/p>\n<p>For hemp extract products to dance freely in the Florida market, they must pirouette through a series of strict procedures. Producers have to present a certificate of analysis from a third-party lab \u2013 a graded report card showing that their product not only contains less than 0.3 percent of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (the magical THC) but is also clean from any harmful impurities. Packaging is another battleground, where each product must don an informative suit \u2013 complete with a scannable barcode or QR code, batch info, and a breakdown of the cannabinoid content. This isn&#8217;t merely a fashion statement; it&#8217;s about ensuring consumer transparency and trust.<\/p>\n<p>The bill&#8217;s protective stance girds against enticing the youth with such products, drawing a clear age boundary \u2013 no hemp extract sales to those under 21. Additionally, it states its dose dos and don&#8217;ts, setting strict limits on the total THC content per serving and package, and demands child-resistant packaging compliant with the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970. SB 1676 makes no bones about safeguarding Floridian children from the allure of the forbidden leaf.<\/p>\n<p>The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services enters this fray not as a spectator but as the referee, tasked with setting the game rules. From THC concentration test procedures to the grim fate of non-compliant plants, the department will have its hands full establishing regulations that minimize the risk of underage fascination and carefully curating advertising practices to sustain a responsible, transparent market.<\/p>\n<p>As SB 1676 unfurls its leaves, it hints at reshaping the cannabis conversation by explicitly incorporating different THC isomers in the total THC calculation for hemp products. This meticulousness further estranges &#8216;marijuana&#8217; from &#8216;hemp&#8217; and &#8216;industrial hemp&#8217;, sustaining the legal boundaries amidst a landscape often blurred by scientific and social nuances.<\/p>\n<p>But SB 1676 doesn&#8217;t come without its contentious thorns. It banishes synthetically derived cannabinoids from the hemp kingdom, provoking likely ire and debate from producers who dabble in synthetic processes. And its restrictive embrace on sales \u2013 particularly regarding age and THC limits \u2013 may well ruffle feathers amid those lobbying for more liberal cannabis freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Florida&#8217;s SB 1676 is arching its back, ready to spring into action on July 1, 2023. Whether Florida residents will bask in its shade or find themselves caught up in this great THC tug-of-war remains to be seen. Yet, as the bill&#8217;s roots dig deeper seeking legislative nourishment, it&#8217;s undeniably clear: Florida&#8217;s legal fabric might soon be dyed with a brand new hue of green.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hemp In the sunny state of Florida, a new game of give-and-take is unfolding on the legal landscape that could well be dubbed &#8220;The Great THC Tug-of-War&#8221;.
