House Resolution 8033 marks a solemn recognition by the Florida House of Representatives, carving September 2023 into the calendar as &#8216;Childhood and Adolescent Cancer Awareness Month.&#8217; Yet, behind the formal decree lies a stark and distressing reality: a dire statistic that pronounces one in every 285 children in Florida will be diagnosed with cancer before they blow out their 20th candle.<\/p>\n<p>Cancer\u2014often seen as a thief of maturity\u2014does not discriminate. Regardless of ethnicity, class, or locale, this disease strikes with blind indifference, embedding itself into the lives of over 15,000 families across the United States each year. In this sunshine state, the numbers are grim. Florida&#8217;s children and adolescents fall prey to this ruthless culprit, making cancer the reigning cause of death by disease post-infancy in our nation&#8217;s young.<\/p>\n<p>Parents clutching the hands of their little warriors find themselves standing at the edge of an abyss that is both deeply personal and sweeping in its implications. Florida&#8217;s households are all too familiar with the echo of this affliction, and the insights from medical experts are sobering. Childhood cancer&#8217;s reach extends far beyond the grueling battleground of treatments\u2014radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. As many as two-thirds of brave survivors bear the scars of battle in the form of late-term effects. These remnants of war against cancer can lay dormant only to arise years later, a shadow cast over what many hoped would be a triumphant return to life.<\/p>\n<p>But within these WHEREAS clauses of 8033 lies a pulse of hope beating against the statistics. Amidst the turbulence, we&#8217;ve watched survival rates climb to exceed 80 percent for certain types of childhood cancer. Yet, these numbers are not uniform\u2014they are fickle and fluctuate depending on the type of cancer and the tender age of the patient.<\/p>\n<p>Survival is not a solitary feat. The fabric of support is rich and diverse, knit together by healthcare professionals, relentless researchers, generous philanthropies, and social support networks. With hands held and hearts hopeful, they form an alliance providing more than treatment\u2014they gift moments of normalcy, a belly laugh, an escape from the IV drip, and the resources to ensure that young lives can not just survive, but flourish.<\/p>\n<p>This September will not simply pass as another turn of the calendar page. In Florida, it will stand as an emblem\u2014thirty days set aside to sound the trumpet louder, shine a light deeper, and rally the troops further. It will be a clarion call to draw attention to the boundless resilience of our state&#8217;s youngest fighters, the enduring side effects that shadow their victories, and the imperative for early detection and immediate action.<\/p>\n<p>It is a time to embolden scientific endeavor, to fuel the quest for cures and kinship in care. For if research is the compass, hope serves as our north star. &#8216;Childhood and Adolescent Cancer Awareness Month&#8217; transcends beyond mere recognition; it serves as a catalyst for change, benchmarking our commitment to those one in 285 stars, ensuring no child is lost in the immensity of the night sky.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Childhood and Adolescent Cancer Awareness Month One in 285: The Alarming Statistic Behind Florida&#8217;s Cancer Plague in Kids In the sun-drenched state of Florida, a storm is rolling in\u2014a storm not of wind and waves, but of an urgent health crisis gripping our youngest generation.
