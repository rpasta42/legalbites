Whether it&#8217;s a box of 9mm for a Saturday at the range or a case of birdshot for the next hunting season, no one can dodge this scrutiny. Licensed collectors, badge-carrying law enforcers, and those who legally conceal and carry aren&#8217;t exempt from this intense targeting either.<\/p>\n<p>Exceptions to this new requirement scatter like buckshot\u2014ammunition transfers at shooting ranges, hunting trips, and fishing ventures, or when the seller can safely bet that the buyer&#8217;s intentions are as clean as a polished barrel. And what if technology jams? The bill has a contingency plan similar to what dealers do now when firearm background checks are delayed due to system malfunctions. But make no mistake, such stoppages won&#8217;t let anyone bypass the law when the system is back online.<\/p>\n<p>Clerks of courts and law enforcement agencies, prepare to be conscripted into this legislative army, as the proposal would require your offices to provide critical records to assist in determining an individual&#8217;s eligibility to purchase bullets and shells. This facet of the bill seeks to tighten the chamber on preventing ineligible individuals from stockpiling ammunition, aligning with the intent to keep guns out of the wrong hands.<\/p>\n<p>But pull the trigger on a false declaration during the buying process, and there&#8217;s a legal recoil waiting. SB 180 doesn&#8217;t just aim at buyers; employees and agencies that facilitate these transactions with falsified information will find themselves in the legislative line of fire, facing potential penalties that could be as severe as a misfire in a closed chamber.<\/p>\n<p>Now, what about the concerns from the gallery? Some argue this legislation could become a slug to Second Amendment rights\u2014similar objections have been echoed each time firearm background checks have been debated. And while some lawmakers gun for SB 180 as a method to reduce gun violence, others see it as a shot in the dark, burdening law-abiding citizens without a clear target on crime reduction.<\/p>\n<p>SB 180&#8217;s pursuit to increase ammunition sale safety by banning bullet buys from individuals prohibited from gun ownership is undeniably contentious. While technical adjustments to the legislative script may clarify the language, the real issue remains clear as a rifle\u2019s sight: How far will Florida go to prevent potential violence without crossing the line that protects its citizens&#8217; rights?<\/p>\n<p>Branded as \u2018Jaime\u2019s Law,\u2019 in remembrance of a life lost to gun violence, and poised to engage on October 1, 2024, should it pass the sunset-shrouded halls of the Florida Legislature and survive the political battlefront, SB 180 is a bill to watch with a keen eye and a steady aim. Florida residents and gun owners: keep your powder dry, this legislative clash is far from over.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sale or Transfer of Ammunition Attention Gun Owners Across the Sunshine State: SB 180 is loading up for a dramatic chamber showdown, and if it hits its mark, ammo sales in Florida may be shackled with the same chain of background checks currently clasped around firearms. \u2018Jaime\u2019s Law,\u2019 the proposed amendment to Florida Statute 790.065, [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":19809,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1517],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Gun Owners Beware: Florida&#039;s Ammo Background Check Bill Sparks Outrage!
