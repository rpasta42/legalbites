Florida House Resolution 8069 \u2013 HR 8069 \u2013 introduced this year, has a dire message for its people: our hearts are at hazard. &#8220;Hazardous Hearts: The Alarming Truth About Florida\u2019s No.1 Killer!&#8221; is not just a headline; it\u2019s a wake-up call to acknowledge the lurking dangers of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD).<\/p>\n<p>February 2023 has been designated by this serious and urgent resolution as &#8216;Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Awareness Month,&#8217; making it clear that this is not just about marking days on a calendar, but a fight for life and death. In the U.S., cardiovascular diseases ruthlessly claim the top spot as the leading cause of death, outmatching every other health scare we face today.<\/p>\n<p>The fight against this invisible foe is daunting; about 21 million Americans have been diagnosed with ASCVD, which remains largely misunderstood by the public. This condition is not just a medical term, it represents the millions of stories, repeated hospital visits, and loved ones lost. In Florida, this hits particularly close to home with an estimated 2 million adults diagnosed or informed by health professionals that they&#8217;re battling against the tides of coronary artery disease, heart attacks, or strokes.<\/p>\n<p>However, aggressive the statistics, there are heroes in this battle \u2013 though not all combat is on the frontline. Lipid-lowering therapies like statins, the cavalry of the medical field, fight to pull down the menacing levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), known for their villainous role in building up artery-clogging plaque. <\/p>\n<p>But a disturbing fact has surfaced from the depths of a study by the University of California \u2013 a mere 20 percent of the ASCVD-afflicted who were on statins reached the shores of healthy LDL-C levels. This means the majority are adrift in dangerous waters, with their conditions uncontrolled, silently progressing towards the inevitable.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019 alone, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the malevolent specter of ASCVD was marked as the grim reaper in the underlying causes of death for 34,781 Floridians. These are not just numbers; they are empty seats at dinner tables, they are silent bedrooms, they are birthdays that will never be celebrated again.<\/p>\n<p>HR 8069 is not just a legislative document \u2013 it&#8217;s a spearhead piercing through the thick fog of ignorance, aiming to thrust the gruesome reality into the spotlight, to promote not just understanding but action. The resolution underscores the critical need for both the general public and healthcare professionals to put up a formidable defense. Recognizing the monthly observance is a clarion call to arms, urging every Floridian to take charge of their cardiovascular risk factors and to escape the clutches of statistics becoming personal tragedy.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, &#8220;Hazardous Hearts&#8221; may seem like sensationalism, but the truth it seeks to expose is more frightening than fiction. This document, HR 8069, isn&#8217;t just a piece of paper \u2013 it&#8217;s a blueprint for change, for awareness, and, ultimately, for survival. As Florida faces this silent epidemic, it\u2019s time for each heart to become a beacon of health, for every citizen to engage in this battle, making the truth not only alarming but empowering.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Awareness Month Beneath the Sunshine State\u2019s skies looms a shadow, silent but deadly, as it claims more lives each year than any criminal lurking in the dark.
