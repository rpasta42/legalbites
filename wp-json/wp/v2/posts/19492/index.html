Riding under the banner, &#8220;Taxpayer Outrage: Man Loses Leg, State Coughs Up Millions!&#8221;, this new bill, SB 12, brings the gravity of state accountability into the fierce spotlight of public scrutiny. Spearheaded by Senator Ingoglia, SB 12 seeks justice for one man, Mark LaGatta, who bears permanent scars from a brutal collision\u2014scars that extend much deeper than his physical disability.<\/p>\n<p>On an innocuous summer day, July 27, 2020, the lives of the LaGatta family skidded to an unthinkable halt. While navigating State Road 24 in Levy County, Mark and his daughter, Faith, found their motorcycle journey abruptly and tragically interrupted. A Florida Department of Transportation (DOT) employee, lost in a task with a tractor and box blade, made a disastrous error\u2014reversing into the LaGattas&#8217; path with no room for escape. The collision that ensued not only snatched Mark&#8217;s left leg, but also his livelihood, and the emotional well-being of his daughter and himself amid the already tumultuous backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>The aftermath reads like a crafted nightmare: weeks of hospitalization, surgeries too numerous to count, and a fight for life in an induced coma. Yet, through the layers of physical pain lay further torment. Pandemic restrictions barred his five children from his bedside\u2014a psyche-wrenching reality for any parent. Mark&#8217;s career\u2014a maintenance engineer, a role demanding expertise and precision\u2014slipped away, inevitably chased by mounting medical bills, lost earnings, and an uncertain future.<\/p>\n<p>On February 28, 2023, the scales of justice finally tilted in Mark LaGatta&#8217;s favor; the judgment, a staggering $2.32 million. While the Florida DOT already parted with $120,000, this sum paled in the face of the enormity of Mr. LaGatta&#8217;s collective losses. SB 12 calls for an additional $2.2 million from the coffers of the General Revenue Fund to the DOT for Mark&#8217;s relief. It is a figure that some would contest as a payout that is both a necessary correction and a subject for taxpayer indignation.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the most controversial tether to this legal saga is the underline of negligence on the DOT&#8217;s part\u2014a concept that doesn&#8217;t bode well for public trust. This negligence transformed a public servant into a life-altering hazard, throwing established safety protocols into question and shining an unflattering light on the processes that failed to prevent such a disaster.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the bill extends far beyond the numeric sum, stringing along specific directives and stipulations. Once law, it would command the Chief Financial Officer to issue the warrant, finalizing this sum as the catch-all settlement for present and future claims linked to this case. With attorney fees capped at 25 percent of the award, SB 12 ingrains a sobering reminder of the financial aftermath that ensnares those affected by such events\u2014both the compensated and those footing the bill.<\/p>\n<p>As SB 12 lingers on the docket, it presents a dichotomy\u2014the grim narrative of a family altered by institutional misjudgment against a backdrop of taxpayers who may bristle at the notion of their money remedying such a hefty judgment. Yet, at the center, is a man who confronted the unthinkable and emerged with a verdict that acknowledges what some might describe as an irreplaceable loss. Whether this bill passes into law is a matter for the legislature, but one thing remains crystal clear: the ripple effects of one misjudged reverse on State Road 24 continue to be felt far and wide, reverberating through Florida&#8217;s legal channels and the very heart of public debate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Relief of Mark LaGatta\/Department of Transportation In an extraordinary display of legislative action, Florida&#8217;s State Senate faces a bill as shocking as it is contentious.
