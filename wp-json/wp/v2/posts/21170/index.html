But volatile change may be on the horizon for Floridians. A new bill, HB 1533, just might upend the existing prior authorization system. The crucial question that now arises is: Will Florida&#8217;s Prior Authorization Overhaul Be a Cure or a Curse?<\/p>\n<p>The bill, set to overhaul section 627.42392 of the Florida Statutes, throws down the gauntlet by redefining crucial terms. &#8216;Adverse determination&#8217; and &#8216;electronic prior authorization process&#8217; are given concrete definitions, while &#8216;health insurer&#8217; has been swept away, replaced by a broader term\u2014&#8217;utilization review entity.&#8217; This includes not just health insurers but also pharmacy benefit managers, expanding the scope of who&#8217;s bound by the new rules.<\/p>\n<p>In what might be called a tech-forward leap, come January 1, 2024, the bill will require these entities to create secure online platforms. These interfaces must be robust enough to process electronic prior authorization requests and manage documentation uploads\u2014a potentially hefty task for smaller entities.<\/p>\n<p>A boon for transparency, HB 1533 decrees that all prior authorization prerequisites and their corresponding clinical criteria be easily accessible on the utilization review entity\u2019s website. And in the spirit of fair warning, any new authorization requirements cannot take the healthcare providers by surprise\u2014they&#8217;ll have a 60-day heads up.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the most talked-about provision is the stipulation that adverse determinations\u2014decisions denying a request\u2014must be made by physicians with the same specialty as the one providing the care. This potentially game-changing move pegs a bet on higher quality determinations that are contextually sound and patient-specific.<\/p>\n<p>The clock&#8217;s also ticking for utilization review entities henceforth, as the bill imposes strict time limits for decisions on authorization requests: just 2 business days for nonurgent services, and a mere 24 hours for urgent care needs.<\/p>\n<p>But HB 1533 doesn\u2019t stop there\u2014it&#8217;s drawing lines in the sand, flat-out prohibiting prior authorizations in certain scenarios like emergency services, prehospital transportation, and medications for opioid use disorder. This is a clear nod to the need for unimpeded access to critical services and treatments in life-threatening or highly vulnerable situations.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s more\u2014any granted prior authorization can&#8217;t be retracted or modified if given services are provided within 45 business days of the green light. What\u2019s more, if a surgical or invasive procedure gets a thumbs up, no further authorizations will be needed for related procedures during the perioperative period.<\/p>\n<p>For those managing chronic conditions, the bill&#8217;s proposal offers a respite, ensuring that a single prior authorization can cover the entire duration of treatment. These patients could face fewer interruptions and reassessments\u2014a seamless process from start to finish.<\/p>\n<p>Every coin has two sides though, and HB 1533 is no exception. The mandate for secure online platforms promises a technological challenge and could incur significant costs, potentially sparking debate and pushback from smaller entities or those less digitally capable.<\/p>\n<p>And let&#8217;s touch upon what might be the most controversial piece of the bill\u2014the blanket prohibition on prior authorizations for opioid use disorder medications. The move diverges from more conservative approaches aimed at closely monitoring drug use, especially in light of the continuing opioid epidemic.<\/p>\n<p>As this bill gears up to take effect on July 1, 2023, it clears a path rife with promises of efficiency and patient empowerment. However, whether it will materialize as a win for streamlined care or become entangled in resistance and controversy remains an open question. Watch this space, as Florida strides towards a revolutionary juncture that could reshape the healthcare experience for millions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Prior Authorization for Health Care Services In the realm of healthcare, one of the most burdensome administrative hurdles both doctors and patients face is prior authorization\u2014the bureaucratic hoop-jumping required before some healthcare services, procedures, or prescriptions can be provided.
