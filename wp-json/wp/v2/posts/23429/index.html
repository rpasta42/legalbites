HB 6023 is not just another legislative document; it&#8217;s a grim echo of an incident that poses tough questions about accountability and the true cost of a mistake made behind the badge.<\/p>\n<p>On April 7, 2019, a typical Florida day turned catastrophic when a St. Johns County Sheriff&#8217;s Office patrol met disaster head-on. Julia Perez, aged 51, and her companion were enjoying a motorcycle ride\u2014one that should have ended with memories, not misery. However, Deputy Brandon Hetzler&#8217;s failure to yield in his marked patrol vehicle triggered a sequence of events, leading not to assistance but to an ambulance for Ms. Perez.<\/p>\n<p>The consequences for Ms. Perez have not been mere inconveniences but a nightmarish upheaval of life as she knew it. With mounting medical bills that soar past $3.8 million and projected future costs that burgeon between $3.3 and $4.1 million, it&#8217;s not hard to see why the $15 million compensation figure in HB 6023 isn&#8217;t just a number\u2014it&#8217;s a lifeline.<\/p>\n<p>While Deputy Hetzler&#8217;s siren stayed silent, the repercussions of his actions ring loud and clear. From multiple open fractures to a punctured lung inducing cardiopulmonary arrest, Ms. Perez&#8217;s body kept a harrowing ledger of the accident. The ledger tallies life-altering injuries such as permanent kidney dialysis, traumatic brain injury, and chronic migraines\u2014debilitating tokens of a day that should have never been anything but ordinary.<\/p>\n<p>The Florida Highway Patrol&#8217;s detailed investigation leaves no shadow of doubt: the fault lies solely with the Deputy&#8217;s negligence. But should Floridians shoulder the weight of this $15 million burden? The bill states an intent to waive any state-held liens for Ms. Perez&#8217;s treatment, an indication of the Legislature&#8217;s recognition of the ordeal she&#8217;s been through. Yet, as she stares down a future darkened by her &#8220;totally disabled&#8221; status, the bill also caps attorney fees at 25 percent, a reminder that there&#8217;s no blank check when it comes to restitution.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s cut through the dry legal speak: if this compensation claim from HB 6023 sails through, it won&#8217;t just represent closure for Ms. Perez; it&#8217;ll reflect a broader commitment by the state to make things right. But \u201cright,\u201d by any measure for Ms. Perez, means coping with a reality no amount could fully amend\u2014loss of earnings estimated at $282,110 and an incalculable loss of quality of life. <\/p>\n<p>HB 6023 underscores a narrative that&#8217;s more than about money\u2014it&#8217;s a sobering account of how the actions or omissions of individuals can reverberate through the lives of others, and ultimately, how the public ends up being party to the settlement. The bill is explicit in its singular focus: $15 million is the &#8220;sole remittance for all claims arising from the situation described.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As this legal bill yearns to make law, it is a staunch reminder. It\u2019s a reminder that the stakes are astronomically high when those entrusted to uphold the law falter. For Julia Perez, the compensation might offer some solace, but her daily battles are a testament that the full cost of negligence can never truly be compensated. Meanwhile, for taxpayers, it&#8217;s an alarm bell signaling that their pockets are not unconnected from the misdeeds that occur under the watch of their public servants.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Relief\/Julia Perez\/St. Johns County Sheriff&#8217;s Office ### Taxpayer Alert: You&#8217;re Footing the $15 Million Bill for an Officer&#8217;s Negligence In an age where the axiom &#8220;to protect and serve&#8221;
