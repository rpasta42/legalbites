House Bill 113 is more than just another piece of legislation; it&#8217;s a beacon of hope for consumer debtors who have too often been victims of predatory financial practices. <\/p>\n<p>The bill introduces a slew of robust provisions including a daring section, bound to send shivers down the spines of debt sharks. With the future creation of Section 559.721 in the Florida Statutes, predators in the debt collection ocean might just find their sharp teeth blunted. This section boldly prohibits contact with debtors under many circumstances deemed exploitative, particularly protecting those preyed upon during their most vulnerable moments.<\/p>\n<p>Under the proposed legislation, the villains of this story \u2013 ruthless debt collectors \u2013 will have to think twice before targeting individuals who have been historially easy prey. House Bill 113 delineates classes of debtors and defines the duration of prohibition for each, creating a shield that guards against further abuse. <\/p>\n<p>The genius of the bill lies not just in its protection clauses, but in its promise to hold accountable even those debt sharks swimming across state lines. The days of out-of-state consumer debt collectors circumventing local laws may soon be over, as the bill amends sections of the Florida Statutes to mount enforcement actions against these interlopers.<\/p>\n<p>But the real twist in the tale? The bill wields a gavel of justice for those who have faced the double jeopardy of elder abuse, human trafficking, identity theft, and exploitation of vulnerable adults or who have emerged from the foster care system. One can only imagine the collective sigh of relief from thousands of Floridians who might see their nightmares of financial harassment come to an end.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s not overlook the administrative prowess the bill entails. With a system set to establish administrative duties concerning consumer complaints, the bill sets the stage for a well-oiled machine of consumer protection ready to respond to the distressed calls of financially beleaguered citizens.<\/p>\n<p>And for those debt collectors who assume they can navigate the murky waters of legal loopholes, there&#8217;s a twist \u2013 civil remedies for violations are in place. In other words, cross the line, and you&#8217;ll pay the price, a message that&#8217;s about as welcoming as an alligator in a swimming pool for unscrupulous collectors.<\/p>\n<p>If passed, the impenetrable walls of this legislative fortress could go up as soon as July 1, 2023. The clock is ticking for debt collectors, and House Bill 113 could be the silencer to the often-deafening threats they impose on those struggling to swim away from the depths of debt.<\/p>\n<p>In essence, Florida&#8217;s latest legal move is not just a warning shot across the bow; it&#8217;s a torpedo aimed directly at the heart of a predatory industry. And if this bill sails through, it could very well spell disaster for the ruthless debt sharks who have long circled the waters of exploitation, waiting to strike. With this potential legal safeguard, once-hunted consumers may soon become the hunters, armed and ready to defend their rights with the full might of the law on their side.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Contacting Consumer Debtors In a bold legislative move that could put an end to the relentless pursuit by debt collectors, Florida is standing up for those who are most vulnerable.
