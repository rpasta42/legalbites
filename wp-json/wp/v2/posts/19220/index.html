The Senate has turned its attention to a crisis that has long cast a pall on what should be one of life\u2019s most jubilant occasions. &#8220;Black Mothers in Peril: The Shocking Truth Florida is Scrambling to Address!&#8221; is not just a headline; it&#8217;s a stark reality that the Florida State Senate is trying to confront with the introduction of Senate Resolution 1738.<\/p>\n<p>This resolution is more than a symbolic nod to an ongoing plight; it earmarks April 11-17, 2023, as &#8216;Black Maternal Health Week&#8217; (BMHW)\u2014a moment to cast a glaring spotlight on the stark contrasts in maternal health outcomes that black women face. The effort, piloted by Senator Jones, rides the wave of the national BMHW campaign, resonating with the theme &#8216;Our Bodies Belong to Us: Restoring Black Autonomy and Joy,&#8217; an homage to the black women leading the charge in the realm of sexual, maternal, and reproductive healthcare.<\/p>\n<p>Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are damning: black women in the United States are 2.6 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes compared to their white counterparts. These numbers do not discriminate by socioeconomic status, and Florida&#8217;s own data is a grim echo chamber of these national disparities.<\/p>\n<p>COVID-19 has been no ally to maternal health, unleashing a disproportionate fury on black communities and contributing to a staggering 40 percent increase in maternal mortality in 2021 alone. SR 1738 does not mince words; it calls for tangible, structural reform that includes better accessibility to health care, with a notable emphasis on mental health services, workplace accommodations, and an equitable shake in the criminal justice system.<\/p>\n<p>The need is clear: there must be unwavering support of maternal care spearheaded by those it affects the most. The resolution champions continuous health care coverage for black women during the postpartum period and demands comprehensive maternal health care free from the insidious reaches of discrimination\u2014not just for the everyday citizen but also for those behind bars.<\/p>\n<p>The message of SR 1738 is resounding and clear\u2014it&#8217;s time to facilitate conversations about black maternal health within Florida&#8217;s borders and to carve out policy, research, and care solutions that resonate from within the black community. It places a spotlight on systemic racism and underlying social determinants as the roots of these life-threatening disparities.<\/p>\n<p>By pushing for policies rooted in the frameworks of human rights, reproductive justice, and birth justice, the resolution not only recognizes the injustices but proposes a blueprint for change. It calls upon black women to stand at the vanguard of policies impacting their lives and well-being.<\/p>\n<p>The Senate&#8217;s commitment is eloquently captured within the resolution. It&#8217;s a pledge to lift black women to safer horizons by safeguarding access to health care, assuring safe and affordable housing, carving out equal economic opportunities, ensuring fair treatment within the criminal justice system, and fostering a diverse workforce of perinatal professionals.<\/p>\n<p>Senate Resolution 1738 is not just a declaration; it&#8217;s an acknowledgement that the time for change is now, and the key to this change lies in giving black women the autonomy and joy they rightfully deserve. The Senate is poised to take action, but it&#8217;s up to all constituents to hold them accountable and drive this momentous shift forward. This, as SR 1738 contends, is how we start to mend a system that for too long has failed black mothers in Florida\u2014and across America.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Black Maternal Health Week In the sun-drenched state of Florida, a worrisome shadow looms over the joy of motherhood for its black residents.
