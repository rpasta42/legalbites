Picture this: a series LLC forms what&#8217;s known as a &#8216;protected series&#8217;\u2014effectively a compartment within the company that possesses its own assets and liabilities, separate from its parent and siblings. It&#8217;s a legal fortress within a fortress, each with its own moat and drawbridge.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Florida is certainly not the first state to flirt with such corporate structures. The concept has been floating around for a while, and proponents argue it&#8217;s about flexibility and asset protection. But here&#8217;s where the eyebrows begin to rise: HB 1345 offers protective measures that go beyond what&#8217;s traditionally available, specifically for those who sit on the throne of these protected series.<\/p>\n<p>For our financially well-cushioned friends, this means a newfound ability to shield assets by distributing them across various protected series&#8217;. The bill even spells it out for us in Sect. 605.2401: Become a member or manager of one of these series, and poof, your liability for the debts and obligations of said series vanishes faster than you can say &#8220;asset protection.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Critics are already wielding their pens, ready to dub this as Florida&#8217;s latest gift-wrap for millionaires. The legislation draws a clear line in the sand, giving the wealthy a way to compartmentalize risk and keep creditors at arm&#8217;s length. Indeed, the complainants\u2019 wails might be justified: The bill restricts creditors&#8217; abilities to go after assets tied to a protected series, potentially leaving them in a financial pickle if they&#8217;re on the wrong side of a business deal gone south.<\/p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s not overlook the transitional provision \u2013 a loophole big enough to sail an oligarch&#8217;s yacht through. Serial LLCs formed before this legislation can choose to ignore these new protective moats unless they opt in. This choice, of course, tilts the scales in favor of consistency and predictability for existing entities, but detractors say it muddles the legal waters.<\/p>\n<p>The bill&#8217;s ramifications for foreign protected series and Florida&#8217;s jurisdiction over them furthers the intrigue. When assets and legal battles span states, countries, and continents, this unassuming bill sets Florida as a magnet for millionaires from around the globe looking to play a high-stakes game of keep away with their assets.<\/p>\n<p>Does HB 1345 signal Florida&#8217;s open season for asset hiders? Critics would say yes, painting the bill as a cunning mechanism for the wealthy to dodge the slings and arrows of outraged creditors. Advocates, however, might argue it fosters a secure business climate and affirms Florida as a beacon of innovative financial legislation.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, this is more than just a tweak to the financial rulebooks; it&#8217;s a mighty testament to the growing complexity of asset protection. The bill awaits its fate, and so do the denizens of Florida&#8217;s economically disparate landscape. Will HB 1345 be the shield that millionaires carry to battle, or will it become the rallying cry for those demanding financial equity and transparency? Only time will tell, but Florida&#8217;s new legislation will undoubtedly be a chapter to watch in the annals of legal history.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Limited Liability Companies In an unfolding saga of legislative moves, Florida has just unveiled what is primed to become a bone of contention in the balance of financial privacy and creditor rights: House Bill 1345, or as it&#8217;s now known, the &#8220;Uniform Protected Series Provisions.&#8221;
