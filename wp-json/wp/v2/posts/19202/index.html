Senator Rouson&#8217;s proposed Senate Bill 1720 isn&#8217;t about the weather itself, but rather the stormy implications of flooding that can wash away the dreams and investments of unsuspecting property buyers. Florida&#8217;s property market, hang tight; transparency like never before could either be your savior or your downfall.<\/p>\n<p>In the wetlands of legal reform, Senate Bill 1720 stands as a lighthouse, guiding potential property owners through the murky waters of real estate purchases. Under this startling new piece of legislation, sellers are required to bear their chests \u2013 and their property histories \u2013 revealing in written form the flood risks that lurk beneath their foundations. The bill insists on declarations about water or moisture-related damages from the past decade, whether a lifeboat, in the form of flood insurance, has been in place, and if FEMA, the federal sentry of flood oversight, has marked the property as lying in a flood hazard zone. <\/p>\n<p>At first glance, the bill could be the Noah&#8217;s Ark prospective buyers have been waiting for, promising them a voyage to safe harbor, immune to the hidden perils submerged in the property market. Summarized simply, this wave of reform is endorsement for honesty, ensuring that before any dotted line is kissed by the signing pen, purchasers are privy to the flood tales that their would-be homes are whispering.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, as any seasoned sailor knows, the ocean carries both the calm and the tempest. Critics fear that Bill 1720 might just be an ill wind, pushing property values in flood-prone regions into the doldrums. Sellers may find themselves navigating through a squall as they must gather their historic knowledge of their property, even when memories are as murky as floodwaters, and documents have been washed away by time. <\/p>\n<p>Uncertainty clings to the air like Florida&#8217;s infamous humidity, painting the bill as a potential breeding ground for lawsuits and disputes over what constitutes accurate or comprehensive disclosure. Real estate professionals, treading warily, suggest that this could inundate the market with litigation, as choppy interpretations of what&#8217;s been disclosed clash with buyer expectations. <\/p>\n<p>The bill, which is set to anchor into law on July 1, 2023, should it traverse the legislative gauntlet and receive the governor&#8217;s seal of approval, throws a harpoon into the heart of non-compliance. Sellers, beware \u2013 forgetting or neglecting to share flood tales from yesteryears might not just rock the boat with buyers but could leave you capsized in a sea of legal ramifications.<\/p>\n<p>Is Senate Bill 1720 a harbinger of clarity and protection for consumers, or will it swamp the property market with a deluge of new challenges? One thing is clear as crystal waters: The Florida real estate scene might just be in for high tide changes, where only the well-prepared will stay afloat. Buyers and sellers, it\u2019s time to batten down the hatches \u2013 the storm of debate over mandatory flood disclosures is just gathering strength.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Flood Disclosures for Residential and Commercial Property Sales As storm clouds loom over the Sunshine State, a new bill sparking lightning strikes of controversy has made landfall in the Florida Senate.
